      <description>i find with grayscale images a unique aesthetic that is distinct from full-color images. especially images that are referring to something old where it convey sense of timelessness or nostalgia, as black and white photography has a rich history that dates back to the origins of photography itself.
most photo editors had black and white theme, but i like to do things the hard way, so here is an attempt to do it in JavaScript and html canvas API.</description>

      <description>intro git mirroring is a process of replicating a repository from one location to another one. to ensure that there are multiple copies of the repository available for use when needed. these mirrors can be used as backups, or to ensure accessing repositories easily for large distributed teams.
of course, git mirroring can be done manually by copying the repo files to other locations, but this approach will make it difficult to keep the copies in sync.</description>
